# Hasma - functional programming language

The motivation for hasma is to explore the development of functional languages
and programming language compilation. The syntax is inspired by haskell and
rust.

# Run

To run the demo file inside `./examples/main.hm` do:

```bash
cargo run
```

# TODO

1. Finish the parsing step for the simplified version of hasma.
2. Write the interpreter for hasma.
3. Port to wasm.
